## Notebooks

These are a collection of jupyter notebooks I made for exploring and summarizing what I have learned about some machine learning algorithms. They are just for me to look back through to remind myself how a particular classifier/estimator works and performs under different circumstances. I learned most of these through resources such as 
- **Python Machine Learning (2nd edition)** by Sebastian Raschka
- **Python Data Science Handbook** by Jake VanderPlas
- and many other resources.
