As the agent interacts with the environment a reward signal is created from a reward function. The reward signal acts similarly to a label in supervised learning however it is not a truth label, rather a measure of how well the agent interacted with the environment. Through a series of ineractions the agent learns a series of actions to maximize the reward through an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberate learning.\n",
