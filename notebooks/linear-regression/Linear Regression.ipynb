    "Just like naive Bayesian models are great for early classification baselines, linear regression models are great for early regression baselines. Unlike classification tasks where the goal is to determine the class label for a sample, in regression analysis we are concerned more with predicting some continuous value given a sample."

    "The classical form for a linear regression is often taught in introductory statistics classes as a straight line that fits to the data provided. $$y = mx + b \\ \\ or$$ $$y = w_0 + w_1x$$ where $b$ represents the y-axis intercept and $m$ is the weight coefficient. This form helps to explain the relationship between $x$ (explanatory variable) and $y$ (target variable) such that new $y$ values can be predicted given an arbitrary $x$ following training."

    "Now would be a good time to mention that the 'linear' in linear regression doesn't necessarily mean that only for straight 2D lines. In fact we can use the LinearRegression estimator model to fit to multidimensional linear models of the form $y = a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ...$. This can be visualized as fitting a plane to a point in 3 dimensions and in dimensions higher a hyper plane."
