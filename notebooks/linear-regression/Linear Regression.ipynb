    "Just like naive Bayesian models are great for early classification baselines, linear regression models are great for early regression baselines. Unlike classification tasks where the goal is to determine the class label for a sample, in regression analysis we are concerned more with predicting some continuous value given a sample."

    "The classical form for a linear regression is often taught in introductory statistics classes as a straight line that fits to the data provided. $$y = mx + b \\ \\ or$$ $$y = w_0 + w_1x$$ where $b$ represents the y-axis intercept and $m$ is the weight coefficient. This form helps to explain the relationship between $x$ (explanatory variable) and $y$ (target variable) such that new $y$ values can be predicted given an arbitrary $x$ following training."
